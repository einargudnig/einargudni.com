      "raw": "\n# Old Vault\n\nRemember I wrote these two posts about Obsidian? One was about Obsidian, and the other was about my Vault and how I use Obsidian.\nI still use Obsidian, and I've only come to like it even more than I did.\n\nI started a new vault because I felt I was experiencing some problems with mine. These problems were not significant,\nbut they held me back from genuinely using Obsidian to my advantage.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`My Graph`}\n  src={`/images/obsidian/graph.png`}\n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\n\n**Why I wanted to start over**\n\nMy old Vault was great; I had a lot of content, but I recognized two things I felt I could do better.\nFirstly, I had massively gotten stuck in the [collectors fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/).\nAnd I tried to adopt a structure from someone else but needed to understand that system better.\n\n**What could I do better**\n\nNumber one and two for me were to restart and build up a system I knew would suit myself and my daily life.\nThis structure I started with could have been better, just that there are better ways to learn how to use other systems.\nIt's better to start with the bare basics and gradually add what I want to add.\n\nRemember Gall's law:\n\n> All complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked. [And conversely...]\n> A complex system designed from scratch never works and needs to be patched up to make it work.\n\nI started with a complex system and never used it to my advantage. That is part of why I got stuck in the collector's fallacy.\n\n# New Vault\n\nI have my glass of red wine, and I'm ready to tell you more about my new Vault. I say a new vault, but it's not new.\nI have been using it for 457 days.\n\nHere is a table of content for you to navigate the post if you want.\n\nI started a new vault with no community plugins, just the built-in ones.\nSlowly I figured out what plugins I might want to use and added them by need.\nBelow, I will list the plugins I use when discussing the use cases connected to them.\n\nMy Vault is mainly a task manager and a personal knowledge database.\nI'm slowly improving and adding functionality to my Vault. For example, this summer, I added a people folder to help me remember people's names and professions (I'm not good with names) and connect to others.\n\nIt's exciting to follow the Obsidian community and see how people use their vaults.\n\n> This Vault aims to help me connect my knowledge and improve it.\n> I want to build systems that help me play long-term games. This system allows me to do daily tasks and minimizes the mental load of always trying to remember everything.\n> There are only so many things we can keep in our minds at any moment.\n\n# Systems\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Picture of my system`}\n  src={`/images/obsidian/system.png`}\n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\nThis is the homepage of my system!\nA summary of it:\n\n- top left corner: graph of my Vault\n- bottom left: folders for my notes and search.\n  - the notes under the folders are notes that I recently added\n- top right: calendar\n- middle right: local graph(for the open note) OR backlinks for open Note\n- bottom right: a pinned note containing different callouts\n\nBelow are the various parts of the system I've implemented in my Vault.\n\nNote that I use templates for a lot of this. This is because, in Obsidian, you can leverage templates to do so much dirty work.\nHere you can read more about [Obsidian templates](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates).\n\n## Daily notes\n\nI use my daily notes a lot!\nOne of the first things I did in my new Vault was to set up a template for my daily notes.\n\nMy daily note is my funnel to my knowledge database.\nI capture almost everything in my daily note. From the daily note, the content will either end up in the slip-box (more on that later), the reference folder, or I will not 'archive it'.\n\nI use raycast on my MacBook pro as a launcher, and some genius made an Obsidian daily note shortcut.\nIt's super easy to press Command + Option + T, and my daily notes open.\n\nObsidian has a mobile app, which is perfect for quick capture when you have made some upgrades to it. I sync my Vault to my iCloud (there are more ways to sync your Vault.), so I have the same Vault in my iPhone as in my MacBook.\nI used the button plugin to add a custom button to my daily note.\n\nThese two methods of quick capture have lowered the \"barrier of entry\" for me to dump everything into my Vault.\nSince implementing this, I have spent more time adding content to my slip-box and making new connections.\n\nEverything that goes to my daily notes could end in my Vault! Not all of it does. I use the daily notes to think, so sometimes. It's just some nonsense about my current work project.\nI added a tag to the things I would like to keep on the daily note. For example, I use the #collection tag to collect stuff.\nI'll describe how I use this tag in the weekly notes section below.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`My daily note`}\n  src={`/images/obsidian/daily-note.png`}\n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\nHere is a screenshot of my daily note for today.\nAs you can see, I don't have anything under the **Ideas:**, which means I haven't captured anything for today.\n\n**Plugins & template:**\n\n- [Daily notes plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes)\n- [Templater](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes)\n- Template (daily note)\n- [dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)\n- [button (mobile)](https://github.com/shabegom/buttons)\n- [quick add (mobile)](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/)\n\n## Weekly notes\n\nIn my weekly notes, I add all of my tasks. These are the tasks I want to complete this week.\nMost often, these are long-term-minded tasks that I try to do on most weeks (training, mobility, reading, etc.) combined with more ad-hoc style tasks that I add (pick up this, order haircut, clean apartment, etc.).\n\nI recently added more personal tasks to the bottom of my weekly note. I dearly want to complete these tasks sometime during the week, but to be honest, I've not been good enough at following through with some of them.\n\nRegarding my #collection tag earlier, I've created a user-friendly system at the bottom of my weekly note.\nI use the data view plugin to show every note in the last seven days, which includes the #collection tag.\nBefore I added this, it happened too often that I needed to remember that I had tagged things in my daily note.\n\nToward the end of every week, I review these daily notes to add content to my Vault.\nThis data view query is helpful and lets me easily see what I've tagged in the last seven days.\n\nThe screenshots below are from two different weekly notes.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Weekly note`}\n  src={`/images/obsidian/weekly-note.png`}\n  width={450}\n  height={500}\n/>\n\n<Image\n  alt={`weekly note 2`}\n  src={`/images/obsidian/week.png`}\n  width={450}\n  height={500}\n/>\n\nYou can see on these screenshots that my weekly notes contain a lot of tasks,\nI will go into more detail regarding my tasks below.\n\nIn the second image, you can see how I handle the #collection tag, as I mentioned earlier.\n\n**Plugin & template:**\n\n- [tasks](https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/getting-started/global-filter/)\n- [dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)\n- template (weekly note)\n- [button (mobile)](https://github.com/shabegom/buttons)\n\n## Monthly notes\n\nYou can see how I structure my Vault. I have a monthly note where I link to the weeks of this month.\nI also count how often I finish the personal tasks I set for each week. It's easier, to be honest, when I see that I only complete them once or twice a month.\nBelow that, I have five short review questions in the monthly note. These are short answer questions that help me reflect on my month. It's easy to forget what one accomplishes, even the small wins.\n\n![Monthly note](https://res.cloudinary.com/dik9usnqz/image/upload/v1683236793/month.png)\n<Image\n  alt={`My monthly note`}\n  src={`/images/obsidian/month.png`}\n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\n**Plugin & template:**\n\n- [tasks](https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/getting-started/global-filter/)\n- template (monthly note)\n\n## Tasks\n\nAs of writing this, I have 6990 tasks in my vault.\n\nI use the tasks plugin to make tasks in my weekly notes.\n\nAs mentioned above, I use data view to show tasks in my daily notes.\nThis is how tasks are shown in my daily notes.\n\n![Tasks](https://res.cloudinary.com/dik9usnqz/image/upload/v1683236793/tasks.png)\n<Image\n  alt={`Tasks in my daily note`}\n  src={`/images/obsidian/tasks.png`}\n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\nI have these simple data view queries to only show the tasks with critical due dates.\n\nI've added a keyboard shortcut for both making tasks and completing them.\nHere you can see what the tasks plugin looks like when adding a task.\n\n![More about tasks](https://res.cloudinary.com/dik9usnqz/image/upload/v1683236793/tasks2.png)\n<Image\n  alt={`More about tasks`}\n  src={`/images/obsidian/tasks2.png`}\n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\nThese shortcuts are CMD + SHIFT + ENTER to make a new task and CMD + CONTROL + ENTER to complete a task.\n\nI could use the task plugin more specifically, but I like to keep things simple.\nI could do recurring tasks, for example, but adding every task manually to my Vault makes me feel more in control.\nI use my weekly notes as much as my daily ones.\n\n**Plugin & template:**\n\n- [tasks](https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/getting-started/global-filter/)\n\n## Projects\n\nI recently started using this plugin for my more significant projects.\nHaving a space where I can have a good overview of my tasks is nice.\nEach task gets a note dedicated to where I can store information and wanderings regarding said task.\nI scribble down almost everything I'm wandering and thinking regarding these tasks. It has helped me get up to speed quickly when I continue with a task after I've changed my focus.\n\nI made a projects template that the Projects plugin **always** uses when I make new notes in the project folder,\n\n<Image\n  alt={`My Template for projects`}\n  src={`/images/obsidian/projects.png`}\n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\nI will do a project about my blog and my side projects. I have many notes in my Vault regarding this, and this Project plugin helps me have a better overview.\n\n**Plugin & template:**\n\n- [projects](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects)\n- template (project)\n\n## Spaced-repetition\n\nI read [this article](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) a while back, and I think I installed Anki not even 5 minutes later.\nThis is one of the biggest things I'm trying to keep improving on daily bases. How would've thought that continuously reviewing things again and again would help you get better at them?🫢\n\nI mostly use spaced repetition for general concepts and other things that help me, like keyboard shortcuts (lol)\n\nI use Anki and the Obsidian to Anki plugin to sync my notes to Anki.\n\nI set up an anki hub note that connects all of my notes for each anki deck. I can leverage the Anki software for spaced repetition. I like this setup a lot since it allows me to add to my anki decks straight from my Vault.\n\nMy main decks are about React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. 🤓\n\nI could improve my usage of Anki with Obsidian, but I've at least started. This is one part of my system that I want to use more.\n\nThe article I mentioned above is super good. Even though it's long, I can't recommend it enough!\n\n**Plugin & template:**\n\n- [Obsidian to Anki](https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki/wiki)\n\n## Time blocking\n\nI think this concept originates from Cal Newport's book Deep Work.\nHere are articles about this concept\n\n- [Time blocking](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/time-blocking)\n- [more about time blocking](https://blog.rescuetime.com/time-blocking-101/)\n- there are plenty more articles about this concept.\n\nI use cron as a calendar, and the full calendar plugin gives me access to a calendar in my Obsidian Vault.\n\nWhat I like about Cron, and I like it a lot, is the ease of using keyboard shortcuts. It helps me quickly block my time -> Less friction, more likely to do it.\n\nI've connected and imported events from my personal Gmail and my work calendar to Cron, so now I have them all in the same place. It's accessible in the full calendar plugin in Obsidian, though I use the Cron app more, especially since they launched the iOS app.\n\nHere is a screenshot of my Cron calendar from this week, so you know how my time blocking is.\n\n![Cron](https://res.cloudinary.com/dik9usnqz/image/upload/v1683236794/cron.png)\n<Image\n  alt={`Cron is my calendar. Here is an image of how I time-block my time.`}\n  src={`/images/obsidian/cron.png`}\n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\nMy time blocks are rather general. I have more details about those tasks in Asana (work tasks) and my weekly note.\nI try to block time for the general \"theme\" of that time, which could be a project or more shallow work like emails.\n\nAs you can see in this screenshot, I'm working on a big task for work. We are refactoring our react-router to integrate the version 6.4 changes.\nThat takes some time, but it's a fun and challenging task.\nI'm also working as a contractor for gigOver. This week, I spent some time early in the mornings to work on their project, and last but not least, I do Crossfit.\n\nI might have a couple of invites to Cron, so if you want to try it, you can send me an email or DM on my socials.\n\n**Plugin & template:**\n\n- [Full calendar](https://davish.github.io/obsidian-full-calendar/)\n\n## Shut down ritual\n\nHere are some articles regarding shutdown rituals:\n\n- [Cal newport](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/08/drastically-reduce-stress-with-a-work-shutdown-ritual/)\n- [Timely](https://timelyapp.com/blog/workday-shutdown-ritual)\n\nAt the end of every work day, I take a quick tour and go over to see if I missed some of this.\n\n- Finish tasks in Asana that I finished this day\n- Archive emails on Front that I can archive\n- Commit any updates to GitHub I have uncommitted\n- Finish tasks in Obsidian that I've finished.\n\nOf course, I sometimes forget this, but most days I remember, and It feels good to \"close\" these things off for the day.\nMaybe it's only the placebo, but I feel like I can start the day without the need to 'de-clutter.'\n\n**Plugin & template:**\n\n- This is on my daily note template.\n\n## slip-box\n\nI put all the notes that I want to 'own' into the slip-box\n\nI got the slip-box 'concept' from the book 'How to take smart notes.'\nI'm not going into many details here because there is no correct way to do this. I like how I structure my slip-box, but there are better ways to do it.\nThe topic notes work like an entry point to a particular topic. Here below is a list of my current topic notes.\n\n- 1 systems\n- 2 technology\n- 3 productivity\n- 4 psychology\n- 5 philosophy\n- 6 math\n- 7 physics\n- 8 biology\n- 9 chemistry\n- 10 economics\n- 11 personal finances\n- 12 health\n- 13 hobbies\n\nEvery note in the slip-box is prefixed with the number of the topic it belongs.\n\nIn each topic note, I start to build on these prefixes. Which is nice but also a place I could improve.\nFor example, the technology topic note has many links, and since I work as a software developer, I'm constantly adding new notes to this topic.\nThis is the topic note for technology.\n\n![Topic note](https://res.cloudinary.com/dik9usnqz/image/upload/v1683236793/technology.png)\n\nThe last note I added to my slip-box had this name: `2a2b9c1 - estate typescript`. So I've branched a long way from the technology topic note with the prefix 2.\nThis has pros and cons. I'm slowly building a model of my slip-box note, and I can see how it grows. But I'm also wondering if I can find notes. (Thank god for the search feature).\nTo add, when I reference a note, I do this [[2a2b9c1 - useState typescript]], but there is a neat trick I can use. [[2a2b9c1 - useState typescript|useState typescript]] displays the string after the pipe instead of the full name of the note. It's nice to have the reference to other notes match the text.\n\nIf you look at the graph at the top of this post, I suspect that the technology cluster is the densest \"collection\".\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo, this was quite long 😬\nIt may seem like I spend all my days in Obsidian, but that is not the reality.\nThe more I use my system, the more prolific I become.\nSome days I add more. For others, I don't add anything. I don't want to add stuff that I don't need.\n\nIf you are interested in using Obsidian, please start small. I slowly integrated and tried everything I use in my Vault before I added it to my workflow. I'm also conscious and willing to remove parts of my system if unnecessary.\nBut note that this came on the back of my old Vault not working well with me, so I'm deliberately being patient with my system.\n\n> The ultimate goal of any productivity system is to have a place where you put tasks and reminders safely so they won't be forgotten and done in time.\n> The core reason is that that's the best way to close off 'open loops,' which are nagging sense you forgot something or the random task that will pop up at night before bed.\n> Those loops will constantly suck mental energy until you address them, and your brain will spend energy trying to remind you, often at the wrong time and space.\n\n[Shawn Blanc](https://shawnblanc.net/) noted that \"there is no one-size fits all system for your tasks, time, and goals. A good system should include these elements:\"\n\n- Allows you to clarify your priorities\n- It's something you understand and enjoy using\n- It allows you to focus on the _right_ things at the right time\n- Efficiency: you're able to do more in less times (instead of taking a long time to do very little)\n- Anxiety and stress are reduced (not exasperated)\n- You know if you hit the mark\n- It's repeatable and sustainable.\n\nKeep these points in mind when you start building your system 🧐\n\nI hope you guys enjoyed this post and that it was helpful in some way.\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n\n## CheatSheet\n\nI have mentioned before that Obsidian uses markdown files. Which is great and means that I don't necessarily need Obsidian to write my notes. I can use any text editor and write my notes in markdown.\nMarkdown is an easy language to learn, and I recommend you know it.\nMy blog posts are also written in markdown.\n[Here is a free cheat sheet with markdown basics and Obsidian keyboard shortcuts.](https://einargudni.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-cheatsheet)",

      "raw": "\n\n# What?\n\nThis is a project that has no purpose other than being for fun. A small little nextjs website connected to a database. For a group of friends going to Oktoberfest in Munich. This website lets us count our drinks, and count how many bratwursts we eat as long as including a 4x4 bingo card.\n\nHowever, I got the idea to build it late so I had to see what I could find to help me make this work in a short time. Below you can see some of the things I found that helped me make this ready in a shorter time.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`oktoberfest logo`}\n  src={`/images/oktoberfest/oktoberfestFrame.png`}\n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\n# Stack\n\n<Image \n  alt={`stack`} \n  src={`/images/oktoberfest/stack.png`} \n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2} \n/>\n\n## NextJs + TailwindCSS\n\nIt is so easy to spin up a project while using NextJs and TailwindCSS. It has become my go-to stack since I’m most comfortable with these two.\nI was thinking about trying out something new, using [bun](https://bun.sh/) or [remix](https://remix.run/) but since I was focusing on getting better at TypeScript I felt like that was enough this time.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nI’m trying to get better at TypeScript. That’s also a reason why I wanted to do this project, I’ve been taking some courses but the best way to learn is to use the technology in a real project, i.e. not in a course. I\n\n## Supabase\n\nI needed a database to store the values since this site was going to be accessed on multiple devices.\nI heard about Supabase on fireship's youtube channel a couple of months ago and thought this would be a great time to try it out.\n\nIt was super easy to set up a database and start to play around with it.\nHere are some examples I used to get more comfortable using supabase:\n\n- https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-nextjs\n- https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-nextjs\n- https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres\n\nI made two tables, one for drinks and another one for miscellaneous things. This made is easier to play around, I also duplicated the react-supabase hooks and connected them to the two different tables.\n\nI wanted to change this back to a single table and only have one instance of the react-supabase hooks. But since the time before Oktoberfest was tight I put it close to the bottom of priority do. It works, so I’ll probably leave it like how it is.\n\nHowever, I suspect I don’t have to change the code much to make this work. In the react-supabase hooks I’m selecting what columns to affect and I could pass different type of columns to the hook if I only had one table. That table would, of course, have to have more columns that would identify either the added drinks to the table or the other stuff added.\n\n### react-supabase\n\nIt’s not necessary to use this npm package to use supabase. But, it made things rather simple, see more in the [documentation](https://react-supabase.vercel.app/)\n\nI used the `useInsert` and the `useRealtime` hooks.\n\nIt was surprising how little code I used to make this work with the database. For both table, I used around 20 lines of code\n\n```tsx\nimport { useInsert, useRealTime } from 'react-supabase'\n\nconst TABLE_NAME = 'drinks'\n\nexport function useDrinkClicks() {\n  const [{ data, error }] = useRealtime(TABLE_NAME, {\n    select: {\n      columns: 'id, type',\n    },\n  })\n\n  if (error) {\n    console.error(error)\n  }\n\n  return data\n}\n\nexport function useInsertDrinksClicks() {\n  // eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars\n  const [_data, execute] = useInsert(TABLE_NAME)\n\n  return execute\n}\n```\n\n- The `useRealtime` hook does return an array of everything in the database selected by these two columns.\n  I could’ve filtered out types of buttons there (`type: beer`) and only returned that to the counter. But Since\n\n- The `useInsertDrinksClicks` hook does simply insert the type to the table we mention above.\n\nBy using those two simple hooks I could in a rather easy way return an array of everything in the table and again add to the same table.\n\n### react-use\n\nI used the `usePrevious` hook from [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use#readme), it’s a custom hook that returns the previous state.\nThis hook is used to compare the current state to the previous one, and if they do not match. A react-spring animation will fire when the count updates.\n\n# Counter\n\nThis is a super simple Realtime counter. It’s inspired by this [example](https://pablopunk.com/posts/how-to-create-a-real-time-ui-with-nextjs-and-supabase)\n\nIt uses two hooks from the react-supabase and one hook from react-use npm package. These hooks simplify the process of inserting to the database quite a lot. It does leave some things out, but they did great for this project.\n\nThe first thing to do is to make the buttons and set the type of them and the label. The type is then inserted to the supabase database alongside a uuid\n\n```tsx\nconst drinkButtons = [\n  {\n    type: 'beer',\n    label: '🍻',\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'wine',\n    label: '🍾',\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'cocktail',\n    label: '🍹',\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'shot',\n    label: '🥃',\n  },\n]\n```\n\nThe logic for the buttons is way more simpler than I though it would be when I started.\nThere is also some logic for the react-spring package that was used to animate the buttons.\n\n```tsx\n//\nconst clicks = useDrinksClicks()\nconst prevClicks = usePrevious()\nconst insertClicks = useInsertDrinkClicks()\nconst clickedButton = (type: string) => () => insertClicks({ type })\n\n\n//\n{drinksButton.map((button) => {\n\tconst clicksForType = clicks?.filter((c) => c.type === button.type).length || 0\n\tconst prevClicksForType = prevClicks?.filter((c) => c.type === button.type).length || 0\n\n\t// This next code is for the animation of the buttons on change, because animations are cool\n\tconst [styles, api] = useSpring(() => ({\n\t...from,\n\tconfig: {\n\t\tduration: 2000,\n\t},\n\t}))\n\n    // this is also for the animation\n\tif (clicksForType !== prevClicksForType) {\n\t\tapi.start({ to })\n\t\tsetTimeout(() => api.start({ to: { ..from } }), 400)\n\t}\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t<animated.button\n\t\t\tstyle={styles} // config for the color changes on animation\n\t\t\tonClick={clickedButton(button.type)}\n\t\t\tkey={button.type}\n\t\t\tclassName=\"text-4xl m-2 p-2 transition border rounded-lg shadow-md hover:scale-110 hover:border-accent focus:outline-none\"\n          >\n\t\t\t<span>{clicksForType}</span> {/* the number of drinks in the database with this type */}\n\t\t\t<span>{button.label}</span> {/* the label we defined at the top of this snipped */}\n\t\t</animated.button>\n\t)\n})}\n```\n\nThe logic is simply displaying the length for the array of a certain type in the database, we use the `clicksForType` variable to filter everything from the realTime database (by using `const clicks = UseDrinksClicks`). By filtering using the types we made above.\n\nWe then use the onClick handler to use the `clickedButton(button.type)` to insert the new value into our database.\nWhat the `clickedButton` does is only using the `useInsertDrinkClicks` to insert a uuid and a type to the bottom of our table.\n\n<Image \n  alt={`counter`} \n  src={`/images/oktoberfest/counter.png`} \n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\n# Bingo\n\n## First iteration\n\nMade up around 20 strings, similar to: “Everyone starts to sing”(something that could logically happen on Oktoberfest). I randomized the array and then took 16 of the strings and made a bingo tile\n\n## Second iteration\n\nOn the day before we went to the venue, I remembered that I had not made any attempt at all to store the value of each card in any kind of storage, so the checked values would keep between the user closing the webpage.\nÁstráður was a real champ and was not long to hack a nice logic for this to work. It was not the best solution and had some bugs, but in the end, it worked well enough.\n\nWe also added extra buttons where you could randomize your tiles again when you win. Before this did automatically happen on refresh, but that’s exactly **not** how we wanted it to be.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`smaller bingo`}\n  src={`/images/oktoberfest/smallerbingo.png`}\n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\n## Third iteration\n\nThis was done between days on oktoberfest itself. We wanted to add more tiles to the card it expanded from 4x4 to 4x6 card.\n\nI forgot yo update the logic so a user could have bingo for every four diagonal in a row, when in fact a user shouldn’t be able to get a diagonal bingo when the card is 4x6. It was not a major issue 🤷\n\n<Image\n  alt={`bigger bingo`}\n  src={`/images/oktoberfest/biggerbingo.png`}\n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\n# Extra touches\n\n### Sound\n\nI had the best time playing around with Josh W. Comeu `useSound` hook.\nI recorded a snipped of google translate saying Prost and added it to a button on the home page. This hook has a setPlayback hook so every time a user pressed the next play of the Prost would be a tiny bit sped up compared to the one before.\nThere is more info on this useSound hook in its [github repo](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/use-sound)\n\n### Confetti\n\nI found this cool [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-canvas-confetti) that displayed confetti when a button is pressed. I added it to my project and made so that when a user wins bingo his screen gets confetti fireworks\n\n<Image \n  alt={`confetti`} \n  src={`/static/images/blog/oktoberfest/confetti.png`} \n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\n## What next?\n\nI would like to make some time in the near future to update this a tiny bit.\nI would like to make the opportunity for people to add new bingo tiles without having to open the code.\n\nIt would also be cool to have independent drinks counter for each user, that would be connected to user authentication.\n\nSince this is not a top priority of mine I’ll see when I manage to do it, maybe it will be soon or in a couple of months. Who knows..\n\nThe code here is not complete, so check it out in the [github repo](https://github.com/einargudnig/oktoberfest22) if you want to fork it and play around with it.\n",

    "title": "Building an Image Gallery with Next.js, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS",
    "publishedAt": "2022-03-28",
    "summary": "Learn how to create an image gallery with dynamic content from a PostgreSQL database, with support for content updates without needing to redeploy.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nThis tutorial will show you how to create a Next.js application that:\n\n-   Fetches content from a PostgreSQL database (Supabase)\n-   Updates content without needing to redeploy to Vercel\n-   Serves optimized, blur-up images with `next/image`\n-   Easily styles components with Tailwind CSS\n\nI used this to create [swag.vercel.app](https://swag.vercel.app), which is a collection of tweets from the Next.js community showing off their swag.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo set up your application, we can use `create-next-app` to clone a Next.js and Tailwind CSS starter application from the official [examples directory](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss).\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app --example with-tailwindcss image-gallery\n```\n\nThis example includes:\n\n-   The latest version of Next.js\n-   Prettier configured to format code and organize Tailwind CSS class names\n-   TypeScript configured for Next.js\n-   Tailwind CSS configured to strip away unused class names\n-   An example Next.js [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n\n## Styling the Image Gallery\n\nNow that Tailwind is configured, we can create components to style our image gallery. Inside `pages/index.tsx`, which is the entry point into our application, let's use CSS Grid to set up the container for our images. We'll add some padding and grid spacing, which conditionally changes based on the viewport.\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nexport default function Gallery() {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<div className=\"max-w-2xl mx-auto py-16 px-4 sm:py-24 sm:px-6 lg:max-w-7xl lg:px-8\">\n\t\t\t<div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-10 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-8\">\n\t\t\t\t{/* Images will go here */}\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nNext, we need to create a component for the individual image. Not only do we want to show the image, but we also would like to show some additional metadata. In this instance, I'm adding a name and Twitter handle. Each image will also link out to the original tweet.\n\nLet's make a new component with placeholder data:\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nfunction Image() {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<a href=\"#\" className=\"group\">\n\t\t\t<div className=\"w-full aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden xl:aspect-w-7 xl:aspect-h-8\">\n\t\t\t\t<img\n\t\t\t\t\talt=\"\"\n\t\t\t\t\tsrc=\"https://bit.ly/placeholder-img\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclassName=\"group-hover:opacity-75\"\n\t\t\t\t/>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<h3 className=\"mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700\">Lee Robinson</h3>\n\t\t\t<p className=\"mt-1 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900\">@leeerob</p>\n\t\t</a>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nWe're using [group modifiers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#styling-based-on-parent-state) to make the hover area the _entire_ component, including the text, making the image's opacity dimmed. We're also ensuring the image maintains a 1:1 aspect ratio (square), which requires a Tailwind CSS plugin. Let's install that.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio\n```\n\nThen, we can update our `tailwind.config.js` file:\n\n```js title=\"tailwind.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n\tcontent: ['./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],\n\ttheme: {\n\t\textend: {}\n\t},\n\tplugins: [require('@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio')]\n};\n```\n\n## Optimizing Images\n\nTo help achieve good [Core Web Vitals](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance), we want to optimize images. Next.js provides an [Image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) that gives us:\n\n-   **Faster Page Loads:** Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport\n-   **Visual Stability:** Prevents [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance/cls) automatically\n-   **Improved Performance:** Images use modern image formats (like WebP) for smaller file sizes and serve smaller images based on the device size\n\nLet's update our `Image` component to use `next/image`, and rename it to `BlurImage` to prevent a naming collison with the `Image` component we imported:\n\n```jsx {1,7-13} title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nfunction BlurImage() {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<a href=\"#\" className=\"group\">\n\t\t\t<div className=\"w-full aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden xl:aspect-w-7 xl:aspect-h-8\">\n\t\t\t\t<Image\n\t\t\t\t\talt=\"\"\n\t\t\t\t\tsrc=\"https://bit.ly/placeholder-img\"\n\t\t\t\t\tlayout=\"fill\"\n\t\t\t\t\tobjectFit=\"cover\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclassName=\"group-hover:opacity-75\"\n\t\t\t\t/>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<h3 className=\"mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700\">Lee Robinson</h3>\n\t\t\t<p className=\"mt-1 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900\">@leeerob</p>\n\t\t</a>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nWe'll use the [fill layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#layout) and `object-fit` [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) to properly scale the image.\n\nThe Next.js Image component requires an allowlist to specify which domains we can optimize images from. While we're using `bit.ly` as a placeholder, we can add any domain we want to the allowlist inside `next.config.js`:\n\n```js title=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nmodule.exports = {\n\treactStrictMode: true,\n\timages: {\n\t\tdomains: ['bit.ly']\n\t}\n};\n```\n\n## Blurred Placeholders for Images\n\nWhen images are loading, we'd like to show a blurred version for a better user experience. While the Image component does include this for [local image files](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization#local-images), we're going to be retrieving images from Supabase soon. Instead, we can use `onLoadingComplete` and CSS animation + blur to achieve a similar effect.\n\n```jsx {2,4-6,9,19-25} title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nimport Image from 'next/image';\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction cn(...classes: string[]) {\n\treturn classes.filter(Boolean).join(' ');\n}\n\nfunction BlurImage() {\n\tconst [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t<a href=\"#\" className=\"group\">\n\t\t\t<div className=\"w-full aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden xl:aspect-w-7 xl:aspect-h-8\">\n\t\t\t\t<Image\n\t\t\t\t\talt=\"\"\n\t\t\t\t\tsrc=\"https://bit.ly/placeholder-img\"\n\t\t\t\t\tlayout=\"fill\"\n\t\t\t\t\tobjectFit=\"cover\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclassName={cn(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'group-hover:opacity-75 duration-700 ease-in-out',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tisLoading ? 'grayscale blur-2xl scale-110' : 'grayscale-0 blur-0 scale-100'\n\t\t\t\t\t)}\n\t\t\t\t\tonLoadingComplete={() => setLoading(false)}\n\t\t\t\t/>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<h3 className=\"mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700\">Lee Robinson</h3>\n\t\t\t<p className=\"mt-1 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900\">@leeerob</p>\n\t\t</a>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's replace our placeholder data with real items from Supabase.\n\n## Setting Up Supabase\n\n[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) makes it really easy to create your [backend](/blog/backend), giving you a PostgreSQL database in a few clicks. Inside our Supabase dashboard, let's configure our new project:\n\n-   Click \"New project\"\n-   Choose your organization\n-   Pick a name, database password, and click \"Create new project\"\n\nAfter your project is created, you'll want to click copy and save these two values:\n\n-   **Project API keys → `service_role`:** This is how we'll securely connect to Supabase on the server.\n-   **Configuration → URL:** This is the API endpoint the Supabase client will use to fetch and edit data.\n\nSave these values as [Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) inside a new file `.env.local` inside your Next.js application:\n\n```bash:.env.local\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-value-here\nSUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-value-here\n```\n\nNext, install the Supabase client:\n\n```bash\nnpm i @supabase/supabase-js\n```\n\nFinally, we can create a new client and connect to Supabase using our environment variables:\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\n\nconst supabaseAdmin = createClient(\n\tprocess.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,\n\tprocess.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\n);\n```\n\n## Adding Data to Supabase\n\nFirst, we will need to create a new table inside Supabase for our images.\n\n-   We'll name our table `images`\n-   We'll keep the `id` and `created_at` columns as is\n-   Let's add `name`, `href`, `userName`, and `imageSrc` columns, which are all `text`\n-   Click \"Save\" and we're done!\n\n<Image\n\talt={`Example of the image gallery`}\n\tsrc={`/images/image-gallery-supabase-tailwind-nextjs/supabase.png`}\n\twidth={2900 / 2}\n\theight={2228 / 2}\n/>\n\nWe can add data directly through the Supabase web editor, but for demonstration purposes, here's how we could insert data using our Supabase client:\n\n```jsx\nawait supabaseAdmin.from('images').insert([{\n  name: 'Pedro Duarte',\n  href: 'https://twitter.com/peduarte/status/1463897468383412231',\n  username: '@peduarte',\n  imageSrc: 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FFDOtLkWYAsWjTM?format=jpg',\n});\n```\n\n## Fetching Data from Supabase\n\nWe've already set up our Supabase client in the file, so we can `select` all images from our `images` table:\n\n```jsx\nconst { data } = await supabaseAdmin.from('images').select('*');\n```\n\nWe'll fetch this data inside `getStaticProps`. [This function](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) allows you to fetch data on the server and return it as props for the default React component exported in the Page:\n\n```jsx {8-15,17-23,25} title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\n\nconst supabaseAdmin = createClient(\n  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,\n  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\n);\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const { data } = await supabaseAdmin.from('images').select('*');\n  return {\n    props: {\n      images: data\n    }\n  };\n}\n\ntype Image = {\n  id: number\n  href: string\n  imageSrc: string\n  name: string\n  username: string\n}\n\nexport default function Gallery({ images }: { images: Image[] }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"max-w-2xl mx-auto py-16 px-4 sm:py-24 sm:px-6 lg:max-w-7xl lg:px-8\">\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-10 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-8\">\n        {/* Images will go here */}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nWe'll also add a type for our `Image` data returned from Supabase. Next, we can update our placeholder for images to use the real data. We'll also use our new `BlurImage` component, which makes use of `next/image` under the hood:\n\n```jsx {5-7} title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nexport default function Gallery({ images }: { images: Image[] }) {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<div className=\"max-w-2xl mx-auto py-16 px-4 sm:py-24 sm:px-6 lg:max-w-7xl lg:px-8\">\n\t\t\t<div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-10 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-8\">\n\t\t\t\t{images.map((image) => (\n\t\t\t\t\t<BlurImage key={image.id} image={image} />\n\t\t\t\t))}\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nAfter mapping through the list of `images`, we forward the current `image` as a prop to our `BlurImage` component. Let's update that component to replace the placeholder data:\n\n```jsx {1,5,9,21,22} title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nfunction BlurImage({ image }: { image: Image }) {\n\tconst [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t<a href={image.href} className=\"group\">\n\t\t\t<div className=\"w-full aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden xl:aspect-w-7 xl:aspect-h-8\">\n\t\t\t\t<Image\n\t\t\t\t\talt=\"\"\n\t\t\t\t\tsrc={image.imageSrc}\n\t\t\t\t\tlayout=\"fill\"\n\t\t\t\t\tobjectFit=\"cover\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclassName={cn(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'group-hover:opacity-75 duration-700 ease-in-out',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tisLoading ? 'grayscale blur-2xl scale-110' : 'grayscale-0 blur-0 scale-100'\n\t\t\t\t\t)}\n\t\t\t\t\tonLoadingComplete={() => setLoading(false)}\n\t\t\t\t/>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<h3 className=\"mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700\">{image.name}</h3>\n\t\t\t<p className=\"mt-1 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900\">{image.username}</p>\n\t\t</a>\n\t);\n}\n```\n\nFinally, we'll want to update our image optimization allowlist to use the Twitter image URL:\n\n```js title=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nmodule.exports = {\n\treactStrictMode: true,\n\timages: {\n\t\tdomains: ['pbs.twimg.com']\n\t}\n};\n```\n\n## Deploying to Vercel\n\nOur image gallery is now showing a list of images, fetched from Supabase, and displayed nicely using Tailwind CSS. Let's deploy our Next.js application to Vercel:\n\n1.  Push your code to your git repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)\n2.  [Import your Next.js project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel\n3.  Add your [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) during the import\n4.  Click \"Deploy\"\n\nVercel will auto-detect you are using Next.js and enable the correct settings for your deployment. Finally, your application is deployed at a URL like [swag.vercel.app](https://swag.vercel.app/).\n\nDuring the build process (`next build`), your application made a request to Supabase (by running `getStaticProps`) to fetch the images needed and generate an HTML file for the page. This file is static and **does not change** when you update your database.\n\nFor example, if you added a new image to the table, it would not be shown on your deployed application without rebuilding the entire app. Let's fix that.\n\n## On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration\n\n[Next.js 12.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-1) included a helpful feature called [on-demand ISR](https://on-demand-isr.vercel.app/) that allows you to fetch updated data for any page _after_ it's been deployed. [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) allows you to keep the benefits of static files (which are fast and reliable) while still updating your site when data changes.\n\nLet's enable our application to re-run `getStaticProps` when our `images` table changes.\n\n### Supabase Function Hooks\n\nFunction Hooks allow you to listen to any changes on your tables and trigger an asynchronous function. For example:\n\n-   I add a new row to my `images` table (i.e. `INSERT`)\n-   My function hook is triggered after the database row changes\n-   I'm able to call an API Route inside my application to fetch new data and rebuild the page\n\nThis means I'm able to instantly rebuild a single page of my application and push the new file to Vercel's Edge Network in 300ms globally 🤯\n\n### Creating our Revalidation API Route\n\nInside our Next.js application, we'll make a new API Route to revalidate our page. This route is secured by a secret query parameter that our Supabase instance will forward, to ensure that only Supabase can regenerate pages when data changes.\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/api/revalidate.ts\"\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n\t// Check for secret to confirm this is a valid request\n\tif (req.query.secret !== process.env.REVALIDATE_SECRET) {\n\t\treturn res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });\n\t}\n\n\ttry {\n\t\t// Regenerate our index route showing the images\n\t\tawait res.revalidate('/');\n\t\treturn res.json({ revalidated: true });\n\t} catch (err) {\n\t\t// If there was an error, Next.js will continue\n\t\t// to show the last successfully generated page\n\t\treturn res.status(500).send('Error revalidating');\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nYou'll then want to add this new Environment Variable to your `.env.local` file, as well as on Vercel, before we deploy these changes.\n\n```bash:.env.local\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-value-here\nSUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-value-here\nREVALIDATE_SECRET=your-value-here\n```\n\n### Creating our Function Hook\n\nInside the Supabase dashboard, click on your Database and then:\n\n-   Click \"Function Hooks\" on the left sidebar\n-   Click \"Create a new hook\"\n-   We'll name our hook `update_images`\n-   Table → `images`\n-   Events → Insert, Update, and Delete\n-   Type of hook → HTTP Request\n-   HTTP Request Method → POST\n-   HTTP Request URL → `your-url.vercel.app/api/revalidate`\n-   HTTP Params → Add a new param `secret` with your secret from above\n-   Click \"Confirm\"\n\nOur function hook is now active and will make a request to the specified HTTP Request URL whenever the `images` table changes.\n\n## On-Demand ISR in Action\n\nFirst, redeploy your application to Vercel to add the new API Route as well as the new Environment Variable (`REVALIDATE_SECRET`). Next, add a new row to the `images` table inside Supabase.\n\nAfter hitting \"Save\", you should see your deployed application **update instantly**!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, we were able to create a Next.js application showing a list of images fetched dynamically from Supabase and instantly update our deployed application whenever data changes.\n\n-   [View the code](https://github.com/leerob/image-gallery-supabase-tailwind-nextjs)\n-   [View the demo](https://swag.vercel.app)\n-   [Try On-Demand ISR](https://on-demand-isr.vercel.app/)\n",
