Once again I'm writing to tell you about my new homepage 😬

This one is far far way from being ready. But there is no need in keeping hidden until it's perfect, because nothing is perfect.

I am that 'shiny new toy'-type that always wants to try out every new thing under the sun.
Especially if I'm excited about said thing. But I try to be conscious about and I have many time decided not to do to much changes to my page.

I was very happy with my old page. The reason for why I'm building a new one is simple:

**TypeScript**

My old site was not written in TypeScript and I had it in the back of my mind that I wanted to convert it.
In my opinion TypeScript **is** the way. And there is not a better way to get better at things other than putting in the reps.

Instead of rewriting the old one I thought of using this as a place to put down some good seeds: Use TypeScript, refresh the design and try out some new things.
I want to continue to build my digital garden, this digital garden is just for fun but, I want to use it deliberately to improve my skill.

So now I can proudly say that I've planted the first seed to my new digital garden. I have so many ideas I want to try out. Some them will probably
not work and I will never publish some of them. But that is what it takes to grow a balanced, beautiful garden.

If you didn't notice it sooner this page heavily influenced by how [Lee Robinsons's page](https://leerob.io/) used to look.
I really really liked the design of it. So I used his design as a starting point. I will make it different over time.

I'm going to quickly go over these first seeds that I planted. I might go more in depth in future posts.

### [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

Tried out the new App router.
I have mixed feelings about it, but overall I like it.

### [ContentLayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)

For my markdown blog posts.
Just so it's clear markdown is fantastic.

### [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

I've been using Tailwind at my daily job for almost three years and I love it.

### [Shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

This is such an interesting project.
I like the copy-paste mentality of it. It's easy to select the components that I want.

### [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)

I did not have any database in my old site. I wanted to try out PlanetScale and I'm very happy with it so far.

I'm not going to have this longer since I'm going to start on one of my side projects now.
I will show you what I'm working on soon.
