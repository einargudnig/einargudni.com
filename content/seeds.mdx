summary: Building a new digital garden
---

Once again I'm writing to tell you about my new homepage ðŸ˜¬

This one is far far way from being ready. But there is no need in keeping hidden until it's perfect, because nothing is perfect.

I am that 'shiny new toy'-type that always wants to try out every new thing under the sun.
Especially if I'm excited about said thing. But I try to be conscious about and I have many time decided not to do to much changes to my page.

I was very happy with my old page, and I have nothing against it. The reason for why I'm building a new one is simple:

**TypeScript**

My old site was not written in TypeScript and I had it in the back of my mind that I wanted to convert it.
In my opinion TypeScript **is** the way. Even though I'm far away to be super good in it I want to get better.
And there is not a better way to get better at things other than putting in the reps.

Instead of rewriting the old one I thought of using this as a place to put down some good seeds.
I want to continue to build my digital garden, this digital garden is just for fun but, I want to also deliberately use it to improve my skill.

So now I can proudly say that I've planted the first seed to my new digital garden. I have so many ideas I want to try out. Some them will probably
not work and I will never publish some of them. But that is what it takes to grow a balanced, beautiful garden.

If you didn't notice it sooner this page heavily influenced by Lee Robinsons's page.
I really really liked the design of it.So I used his design as a starting point.

I'm going to quickly go over these first seeds that I planted. I think these will probably be here for long.

Next.js
Tried out the new App router.
I have mixed feelings about it, but overall I like it.

ContentLayer
For my markdown blog posts.
Just so it's clear markdown is fantastic.

Tailwind
I've been using Tailwind at my daily job for almost three years and I love it.

shadcn-ui
This is such an interesting project.
I like the copy-paste mentality of it. It's easy to select the components that I want.

PlanetScale
I did not have any database in my old site. I wanted to try out PlanetScale and I'm very happy with it so far.
