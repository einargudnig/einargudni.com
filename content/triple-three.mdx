Recently I built a [learnings page](https://remix-workbook.fly.dev/).

Itâ€™s based on [Build-UI Remix course](https://buildui.com/courses/ship-an-app-with-remix). As you can see I have made some minimal updates to it.

Here I will curate interesting things, things I do at work and things I learn.
_This could be whatever I find interesting, doesnâ€™t need to be software related._

The plan is to send out monthly highlights where I share three things from each category, hence the triple three name

I set up a small email service using Resend so you can subscribe to these highlights

This email will contain three items from each category, so nine items in total, Iâ€™ll give some more context for these items, if needed.

Feel free to subscribe ðŸ¤—
