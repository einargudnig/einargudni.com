					I&apos;m currently working as a software engineer at{' '}
					<Link href="https://www.maul.is/" target="_blank">
						Maul
					</Link>
					. We are a close knit team that aim to change the lunchtime at your work!
				</p>
				<p>
					We create a menu for you and your co-workers, this menu is built around
					restaurants and catering services in Reykjavik(and Copenhagen). You order of
					said menu for upcoming week and we deliver the food you and your co-workers
					ordered.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have built a many-to-one relationship, where your workplace has access to
					multiple restaurants each day.
				</p>
				<p>
					We recently launched{' '}
					<Link href="https://www.tiffin.dk/" target="_blank">
						Tiffin
					</Link>{' '}
					which will try to refresh the launch culture in Copenhagen.
				</p>
				<h2 className="font-bold text-2xl font-serif mb-5">Freelancing</h2>
				<p>
					I&apos;m always open to new opportunities, if you have a project that you think
					I could help you with, please don&apos;t hesitate to contact me.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of my freelancing projects is a frontend developer at{' '}
					<Link href="https://www.gigover.com/" target="_blank">
						GigOver
					</Link>
					. I help them build a software used in construction. My current project revolves
					around building a procurement and offer system.
				</p>
				<h2 className="font-bold text-2xl font-serif mb-5">Side projects</h2>
				<p>
					I always have something that I want to build. My main problem is to find the
					time to do it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now my focus is on getting this new version of my homepage ready and make it
					public. It is by no means ready and it will be fun to show you what I have
					planned.
				</p>
				<p>
					I&apos;m not going to wait until it is finished, I&apos;m going to let follow
					along when I build new features.
				</p>
				<h2 className="font-bold text-2xl font-serif mb-5">Health</h2>
				<p>My plan is to live to be at least 100 years old and be healthy</p>
				<p>
					I try to get enough sleep, eat well and train. I&apos;ve been following the
					Strength program from{' '}
